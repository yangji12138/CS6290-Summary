\section{Summary of Paper \cite{SongWP00}}


\subsection{Problem Statement}
Guidelines: Here you should explicitly summarize the problem targeted by the paper. A rough and brief example might be as follows.
%
The paper targets the problem of searching encrypted outsourced data on the cloud.
%
Particularly, how to enable a client to perform search and get the correct search result when both the cloud database and query keywords are encrypted?

\subsection{Problem Significance}
Guidelines: Here you should explain why the problem targeted by the paper is important and has value.
%
In particular, what is the motivation of this paper?


\subsection{State of the Art}

Guidelines: Here you should describe the state of the art as reflected in the paper at that time.
%



\subsection{Contributions}
Guidelines: Here you should summarize the contributions of the paper in your own words.
%
For example, you may evaluate the contributions from the following perspectives: novelty of problem formulation, novelty of the technical solution, depth of theoretical analysis of the technical solution, positiveness of experimental evaluation result, etc.

\subsection{Remaining Questions}
Guidelines: Here you should try to discuss any remaining questions to be solved or any possible future directions based on the result of the paper.
